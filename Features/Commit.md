#Commit#

A commit is a change to the code that is saved by the user. When a collaborator edits code, adds a file, or fixes a bug, they can commit their changes to the branch that they are working from. Each commit has a unique ID that is used to keep a record of what changed, and by whom, and when. By commiting frequently, users can make sure that everyone can stay up to date with their work, and prevent any loss of producticity in case of an emergency. A commit usually contains a commit message that describes the changes made.
