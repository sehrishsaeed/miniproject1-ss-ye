 In Git terms, a "checkout" is the act of switching between different versions of a target entity. 
 git checkout allows the act of switching branches. For example, our main branch is separate from the Features branch that was created later on. By using git checkout,
 it let's us make changes to the main branch without updating the new branch. From the activities we did online, it showed that there a couple of ways to create new
 branches and also check out at the same time. This shortcut command is $ git checkout -b newbranch. This will create a new branch and also check it out.
