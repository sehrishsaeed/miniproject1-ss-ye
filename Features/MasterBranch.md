In Git, "master" is a common naming convention for a branch. In Git, when a new repository is created, it's assigned the master by deault. If for example, a user
decides that they want to clone a repository, the resulting respository has the single master branch. When a repository is worked on and changes have been made (commits),
the master branch will continue to be updated.
