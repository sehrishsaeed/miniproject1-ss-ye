# Pull

In Git, there are a couple of ways to retrieve content from a remote repository and $ git pull is one way. It essentially pulls data from another repository and
then updates the local repository to match it. For example, in this project Sehrish created the main/master repository and Yousuf has made different updates, when he is
ready for the changes to go live Sehrish recieves a pull request. Once accepted and merged, Yousuf's changes are now added to the main repository.
