# Clone

To clone a repository is to make a local (stored on your personal machine) copy of the repository. This copy is also known as a clone. When working from the cloned repository, you can make edits using whatever program you choose without having to be online. Once you are done and can connect to network again, simply push your local changes to the repository to sync. For example, this project, https://github.com/sehrishsaeed/miniproject1-ss-ye, was created by Sehrish, and cloned by Yousuf. Yousuf worked on features, and pushed them to the remote repository when he finihsed the features he was working on.
