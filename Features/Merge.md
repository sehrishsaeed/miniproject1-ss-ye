# Merge

Merging is the action of joining a branch or fork with its parent. This is often done via pull request, but conflicting changes disrupt the process. In that case, the branch must be modified to accomodate the conflicts. Using the compare tool, users can make sure that there are no conflicts before a merge. 

Collaborators accross the project should be careful when submitting a request o merge, as the organization of the broject is dependednt on creating a woekflow that restricts the merging action until it is necessary.
