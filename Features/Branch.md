# Branch

Branching is a copy of the repository that is dependent on its original, ie, deleting the original deletes the branch, but modifiying the original does not change the branch. This allows the users to develop new features independently, and then merge when theyre done. Branching is critical for agile devolpment, and is understanding branching is the first step to GitFLow. 

It is important to keep in mind a few things when learning branching. The first is that an organization system with your team is necessary. The owners of the repository are usually the only ones that can create new branches or merge branches, but everyone working on the project should understand what branches are for what to make sure that conflicting work does not appear in different branches.
