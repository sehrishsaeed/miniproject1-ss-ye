#Master Branch#

In Git, "master" is a naming convention for a branch. After cloning (downloading) a project from a remote server, the resulting local repository has a single local branch: the so-called "master" branch. 
This means that "master" can be seen as a repository's "default" branch. This branch is usually kept exclusively for releases of the product, and is only updated with either hotfixes or fully tested features. This ensures that anyone that wants to use the product is getting  the best possible version. 
The "master" branch is now named the "main" branch by default.
