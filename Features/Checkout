 In Git terms, a "checkout" is the act of switching between different versions of a target entity. 
 The git checkout command operates upon three distinct entities: files, commits, and branches. 
 In addition to the definition of "checkout" the phrase "checking out" is commonly used to imply the act of 
 executing the git checkout command.
